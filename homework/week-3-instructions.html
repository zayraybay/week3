    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>Your hot new rideshare startup, Noober, is about to launch its MVP. Unfortunately, your front-end JavaScript engineer has just left the company to pursue her passion for unicorn farming. You're left responsible for taking data generated by the back-end development team and applying it to the application that is used by end-users. Take a random ride and show it on the driver dashboard; this application will be used by a driver to find a new ride that is waiting to be picked up.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Begin by heading over to <a href="https://github.com/kiei451-winter2021/noober-week3" class="text-pink-500 underline">the starter project</a> – select "Use this template", then create a repository in your own GitHub account called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">hw3</span>. Clone this project and open it in VSCode.</p>
      <p>Open <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span> in Chrome. You'll notice a page with hard-coded data, i.e. every time you refresh the page, you'll get the same result. Your goal is to use what you know about JavaScript to make the page dynamic.</p>
      <p>You should set all of the variables listed in <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober.js</span>. <strong>Setting each variable will automatically replace a value on the page.</strong> Try setting each with a simple <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">let</span> statement to see what part of the page changes. For example, the following code will change the top title to "Tacos":</p>
      <pre class="m-0 p-0">
        <code class="language-js">levelOfService = 'Tacos'</code>
      </pre>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The Goal</h3>
      <p>Each time the end-user clicks "Next Ride", display a new, randomized ride. The random ride data is already provided – simply use the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">ride</span> variable. The provided code writes out the value of this variable to the JavaScript Console in Chrome – inspect the structure of this data using the Console. Your job is to extract the data from this Object, and place it in the various places needed to show it to the end-user.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Business Rules/Rubric</h3>
      <p>With Noober, riders must specify the following data/criteria for their requested ride:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Pickup Location</li>
        <li>Dropoff Location</li>
        <li>Number of passengers in their party</li>
        <li>Whether or not they would like a luxury "Noober Purple" car</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, single riders (i.e. number of passengers is only 1) can request to be part of a "Noober Pool". The back-end development team has already aggregated this data; it's implied that "Noober Pool" is requested when there is more than one rider specified in the ride data. The remainder of the business logic is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>(3 points) The random ride is an Array. If there are more than one "legs" to the ride, i.e. the Array contains more than one element, display "Noober Pool" as the level of service, and show the second and third legs of the ride using the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">passenger-2-x</span> and <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">passenger-3-x</span> variables, respectively. See mockups for an example of a "Noober Pool" ride with two "legs".</li>
        <li>(3 points) If the rider has requested the luxury "Purple" level of service, i.e. <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">purpleRequested</span>, display "Noober Purple" as the level of service.</li>
        <li>(3 points) If the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">numberOfPassengers</span> in a single ride request is greater than 3, we'll need to upgrade to a larger car. Display "Noober XL" as the level of service.</li>
        <li>(1 point) Anything else is the normal level of service, "Noober X".</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Guidelines for Submission</h3>
      <p>All your work should take place in <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober.js</span>; i.e. that should be the only file that's modified from the original project template. Your finished product should live in your GitHub account at <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">https://github.com/&lt;your GitHub username&gt;/hw3</span>, and <strong>this URL should be submitted as the "website URL" for this assignment in Canvas.</strong></p>

      <p>So far we have talked about the basic building blocks in JavaScript – the primitive types – String, Number, Boolean – but just using these types doesn't allow our application to be that sophisticated. A typical business application usually involves some sort of data – apartments for rent, customer profiles, orders, or whatever your business is all about – so we have to learn about a couple of more advanced types that allow us to hold and manipulate data.</p>
      
      <p>We'll begin by talking about the <em>Object</em> – the Object is the the base type of thing in JavaScript; it turns out that everything else is a type of Object. All the types of things we've talked about so far – String, Number, etc. are types of Objects. Objects can either have attributes (<strong>properties</strong>) or behaviors (<strong>methods</strong>).</p>

      <pre class="m-0 p-0">
        <code class="language-js">let myString = 'brian'

        // attributes (properties)
        // we access the properties of an object by using the dot notation and the name of the property
        myString.length // => 5

        // behaviors (methods)
        // we access the methods of an object by using the dot notation with parentheses
        myString.toUpperCase() // => 'BRIAN'</code>
      </pre>

      <p>To elaborate on the difference between properties and methods – for example, if we had a "car" object, it could have properties like color (red), make (Toyota), model (Prius); and it could have methods like "drive" or "park". Properties describe an object's attributes, and methods are a way to ask an object to do something, or return an output.</p>

      <p>This becomes a bit more clear when we create our own objects. In the above example, we are accessing the properties and methods of a built-in object in JavaScript – the String. We can also create our own custom objects, and use those objects to describe our universe, in the context of our application.</p>

      <p>Let's create an object. This object will only feature properties for now – we'll get to creating an object's methods later.</p>

      <pre class="m-0 p-0">
        <code class="language-js">let profile = {
          name: 'Brian',
          location: 'Chicago',
          status: 'Teaching MBA students how to code in JavaScript!'
        }
      
        profile.name // => 'Brian'
        profile.location // => 'Chicago'</code>
      </pre>

      <p>Yes, the curly braces (<span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">{}</span>) have two meanings in JavaScript. We've seen how they're used to separate conditionals in <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">if</span> statements – they are also used to define objects. Once the object is defined and stored in a variable, we can access its properties using dot notation – just like we did with the String in the first example.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">The Array</h3>

      <p>An <strong>Array</strong> is a special type of Object that is meant to hold lists of information. We define an Array using the square brackets – <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">[]</span> – then we have access to its elements, properties, and methods.</p>

      <pre class="m-0 p-0">
        <code class="language-js">let burger = ['buns', 'ground beef', 'american cheese']
        
        // getting or setting value - zero-based
        burger[1] // => 'ground beef'
        burger[3] // => undefined
        burger[1] = 'ground chuck'
        burger[1] // => 'ground chuck'
              
        // array properties
        burger.length // => 3
        
        // array methods
        output = burger.sort() // => ['american cheese', 'buns', 'ground chuck']
        burger.push('ketchup')
        burger.length // => 4</code>
      </pre>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Bringing it Together</h3>

      <p>Basic objects and arrays (and later, methods/functions) are meant to be used in conjunction with each other, to ultimately define more complex objects used in our applications. For example, if we were building a simple social networking application, we might define an object that looks like this:</p>

      <pre class="m-0 p-0">
        <code class="language-js">let profile = {
          name: 'Brian',
          location: 'Chicago',
          timeline: [
            'Teaching MBA students how to code in JavaScript!',
            'Eating tacos',
            'Riding a unicorn'
          ]
        }
      
        // Grab the user's name, location, and current status
        profile.name // => 'Brian'
        profile.location // => 'Chicago'
        profile.timeline[0] // => 'Teaching MBA students how to code in JavaScript!'
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>Just to have a taste of what something like this would work in practice – this object might be generated by a back-end API or come from a database of some kind. A front-end developer would be tasked with retrieving this object and traversing its structure in order to grab the pieces of data needed for the user interface.</p>
